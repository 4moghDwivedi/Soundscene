### Project description

These files include my coding work for our gamification idea, which is based on "whack-a-mole".

 In general, the fidelity of the music is directly proportional to the combined performance of two players. If the players are beating the game, then the music sounds good. If not, then the music sounds terrible.

If the players consistently perform well for a certain number of repetitions, then the patch will advance to a new musical section as a reward.

### Software used
